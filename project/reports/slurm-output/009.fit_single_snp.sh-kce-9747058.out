Performing (standard) linear regression (to instead perform mixed model linear regression, use "--grm")

To perform weighted linear regression, use "--sample-weights"

Consider using "--covar" to provide covariates

Consider using "--top-preds" to include (strongly-associated) predictors as extra covariates

If you would like to perform a permutation analysis, add "--permute YES"

Performing (standard) linear regression (to instead perform mixed model linear regression, use "--grm")

To perform weighted linear regression, use "--sample-weights"

Consider using "--covar" to provide covariates

Consider using "--top-preds" to include (strongly-associated) predictors as extra covariates

If you would like to perform a permutation analysis, add "--permute YES"

Performing (standard) linear regression (to instead perform mixed model linear regression, use "--grm")

To perform weighted linear regression, use "--sample-weights"

Consider using "--covar" to provide covariates

Consider using "--top-preds" to include (strongly-associated) predictors as extra covariates

If you would like to perform a permutation analysis, add "--permute YES"
