Calculating kinships directly

Predictors will be centred then scaled by V^(-1.0000/2) (option "--power"), where V=2*MAF*(1-MAF), the expected variance assuming Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium; to instead scale based on observed variance use "--hwe-stand NO"

Add "--kinship-gz YES" and/or "--kinship-raw YES" to save gzipped and/or text versions of the kinship matrix

If memory is an issue, add "--single YES" (then calculations will performed using single precistion)
