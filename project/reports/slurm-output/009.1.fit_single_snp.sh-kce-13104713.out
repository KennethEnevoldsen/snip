Performing (standard) linear regression (to instead perform mixed model linear regression, use "--grm")

To perform weighted linear regression, use "--sample-weights"

Consider using "--covar" to provide covariates

Consider using "--top-preds" to include (strongly-associated) predictors as extra covariates

If you would like to perform a permutation analysis, add "--permute YES"

Performing (standard) linear regression (to instead perform mixed model linear regression, use "--grm")

To perform weighted linear regression, use "--sample-weights"

Consider using "--covar" to provide covariates

Consider using "--top-preds" to include (strongly-associated) predictors as extra covariates

If you would like to perform a permutation analysis, add "--permute YES"

Performing (standard) linear regression (to instead perform mixed model linear regression, use "--grm")

To perform weighted linear regression, use "--sample-weights"

Consider using "--covar" to provide covariates

Consider using "--top-preds" to include (strongly-associated) predictors as extra covariates

If you would like to perform a permutation analysis, add "--permute YES"

Calculating kinships directly

Predictors will be centred then scaled by V^(-1.0000/2) (option "--power"), where V is the observed variance of the predictor; to instead scale based on expected variance use "--hwe-stand YES"

Add "--kinship-gz YES" and/or "--kinship-raw YES" to save gzipped and/or text versions of the kinship matrix

If memory is an issue, add "--single YES" (then calculations will performed using single precistion)

Calculating kinships directly

Predictors will be centred then scaled by V^(-1.0000/2) (option "--power"), where V is the observed variance of the predictor; to instead scale based on expected variance use "--hwe-stand YES"

Add "--kinship-gz YES" and/or "--kinship-raw YES" to save gzipped and/or text versions of the kinship matrix

If memory is an issue, add "--single YES" (then calculations will performed using single precistion)

Calculating kinships directly

Predictors will be centred then scaled by V^(-1.0000/2) (option "--power"), where V is the observed variance of the predictor; to instead scale based on expected variance use "--hwe-stand YES"

Add "--kinship-gz YES" and/or "--kinship-raw YES" to save gzipped and/or text versions of the kinship matrix

If memory is an issue, add "--single YES" (then calculations will performed using single precistion)

Performing generalized REML with 1 kinship matrix and 0 regions

Variance components can be negative (to prevent this, use "--constrain YES")

Consider using "--covar" to provide covariates

Consider using "--top-preds" to include (strongly-associated) predictors; these will be treated as fixed effects, except that the variance they explain will count towards total heritability

If you would like to perform a permutation analysis, add "--permute YES"

Reading trace of kinship matrix with stem /home/kce/NLPPred/github/snip/data/ldak_results/chr1-22_20k_identity_512_c_snps_train/alkaline.pheno.GCTA
Warning, to store kinships will require approximately 2.7 Gb

Reading kinship matrix with stem /home/kce/NLPPred/github/snip/data/ldak_results/chr1-22_20k_identity_512_c_snps_train/alkaline.pheno.GCTA

Performing an eigen-decomposition; this can take a while
If preferred, you can perform the analysis in two steps; first replace the main argument with "--decompose" (this will save the eigen-decomposition) then restart adding "--eigen"
