Performing (standard) linear regression (to instead perform mixed model linear regression, use "--grm")

To perform weighted linear regression, use "--sample-weights"

Consider using "--covar" to provide covariates

Consider using "--top-preds" to include (strongly-associated) predictors as extra covariates

If you would like to perform a permutation analysis, add "--permute YES"

Performing (standard) linear regression (to instead perform mixed model linear regression, use "--grm")

To perform weighted linear regression, use "--sample-weights"

Consider using "--covar" to provide covariates

Consider using "--top-preds" to include (strongly-associated) predictors as extra covariates

If you would like to perform a permutation analysis, add "--permute YES"

Performing (standard) linear regression (to instead perform mixed model linear regression, use "--grm")

To perform weighted linear regression, use "--sample-weights"

Consider using "--covar" to provide covariates

Consider using "--top-preds" to include (strongly-associated) predictors as extra covariates

If you would like to perform a permutation analysis, add "--permute YES"

Calculating kinships directly

Predictors will be centred then scaled by V^(-1.0000/2) (option "--power"), where V is the observed variance of the predictor; to instead scale based on expected variance use "--hwe-stand YES"

Add "--kinship-gz YES" and/or "--kinship-raw YES" to save gzipped and/or text versions of the kinship matrix

If memory is an issue, add "--single YES" (then calculations will performed using single precistion)

Calculating kinships directly

Predictors will be centred then scaled by V^(-1.0000/2) (option "--power"), where V is the observed variance of the predictor; to instead scale based on expected variance use "--hwe-stand YES"

Add "--kinship-gz YES" and/or "--kinship-raw YES" to save gzipped and/or text versions of the kinship matrix

If memory is an issue, add "--single YES" (then calculations will performed using single precistion)

Calculating kinships directly

Predictors will be centred then scaled by V^(-1.0000/2) (option "--power"), where V is the observed variance of the predictor; to instead scale based on expected variance use "--hwe-stand YES"

Add "--kinship-gz YES" and/or "--kinship-raw YES" to save gzipped and/or text versions of the kinship matrix

If memory is an issue, add "--single YES" (then calculations will performed using single precistion)
